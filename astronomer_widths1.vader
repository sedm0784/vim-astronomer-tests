" Test for g:astronomer_widths

" Had some problems with getting the global variable to work properly with
" multiple test cases in the same file, so testing in separate files.

Execute (Load 4-space indented file: pure/four_spaces.txt):
  set shiftwidth=8
  set tabstop=8
  let g:astronomer_widths = [2]
  edit pure/four_spaces.txt
Then (Check g:astronomer_widths effective at preventing standard indent):
  AssertEqual 8, &shiftwidth
  AssertEqual 8, &tabstop
