" Test for g:astronomer_widths

" Had some problems with getting the global variable to work properly with
" multiple test cases in the same file, so testing in separate files.

Execute (Load 3-space indented file: pure/three_spaces.txt):
  set shiftwidth=8
  set tabstop=8
  let g:astronomer_widths = [2, 3, 4, 8]
  edit pure/three_spaces.txt
Then (Check g:astronomer_widths effective at allowing unusual indents):
  AssertEqual 3, &shiftwidth
  AssertEqual 3, &tabstop
