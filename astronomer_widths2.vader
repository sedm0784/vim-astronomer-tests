" Test for g:astronomer_widths

" Had some problems with getting the global variable to work properly with
" multiple test cases in the same file, so testing in separate files.

Execute (Load 3-space indented file: pure/three_spaces.txt):
  set shiftwidth=8
  set tabstop=8
  edit pure/three_spaces.txt
Then (Check default g:astronomer_widths effective):
  AssertEqual 8, &shiftwidth
  AssertEqual 8, &tabstop
